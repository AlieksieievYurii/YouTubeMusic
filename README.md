# YouTube Music
Quite simple Android application to download and playing music from YouTube. 
The application consists of two main parts: the first part is Saved Music and the second part is YouTube Music where you can download music from YouTube, but first of all, you need to log in.

Media Service is implemented along with the media-compat library. So the app is integrated with smartwatches and cars.

**Downloading musics from YouTube is **not stable**, because Youtube often changes web structure of its pages.**
